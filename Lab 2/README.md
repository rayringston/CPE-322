# Lab 2 - Command Line

## hostname
The hostname command displays the name assigned to the computer on the network. Instead of displaying the IP address, it shows a more readable "nickname" for the device.

## env
The env command list all of the environment variables stored on the computer. Environment variables allow a user to create custom names for certain paths that the computer can easily access. This enables an easier access for programs that need specific files or directories, such as a code editor using a new library.
